## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
getwd()
```

```{r}
last <- read.csv("../data1/shots-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
last
```

```{r}
select(arrange(last, desc(minutes_remaining)), name, total = shot_made_flag)
```
